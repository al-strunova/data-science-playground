# Data Science Playground

Welcome to my `Data Science Playground` â€“ a collection of my explorations and projects in machine learning and data science. This repository, along with others in my account, represents my journey in mastering ML concepts and techniques. It's a showcase of my learning progress, aimed at both sharing my experiences and demonstrating my growing skills to potential employers.

## Repository Structure

`data-science-playground` is organized into several key directories:

- `src`: This folder contains the source code for various data science projects and experiments.

- `data`: Sample datasets that are used in the projects. These datasets are integral for running the code found in the `src` and `notebooks` directories.

- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed code, explanations, and visualizations. A great resource for learning and understanding the data science concepts applied in this repository.

- `predictions`: Contains output files, predictions, or processed data generated by the models or scripts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `data-science-playground`:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-science-playground.git
   
2. Navigate to the repository:
   
    ```bash
